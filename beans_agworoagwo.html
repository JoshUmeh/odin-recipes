    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Beans Agworoagwo is a hearty Nigerian beans porridge that originates from the Igbo ethnic group. It's a comfort
        food staple made by cooking beans until they become soft and creamy, then simmering them in a flavorful blend of
        palm oil, peppers, onions, and traditional seasonings. The dish gets its distinctive name from the cooking
        process where the beans are stirred and mashed to create a thick, porridge-like consistency.</p>
    <p>What sets Agworoagwo apart is its rich, earthy flavor profile from the palm oil and the gentle heat from scotch
        bonnet peppers. Often enjoyed as a complete meal, it's typically served with garri (cassava flakes), bread, or
        fried plantains. This nutritious dish is not only filling but also represents the cultural heritage of Nigerian
        home cooking, where simple ingredients transform into deeply satisfying meals.</p>
