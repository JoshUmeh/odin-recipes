   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>This classic lasagna builds deep, savory flavor by starting with a robust meat sauce. Sauté finely chopped onion
      and garlic until fragrant, then brown a mixture of ground beef and Italian sausage. Stir in crushed San Marzano
      tomatoes, tomato paste, and a generous pinch of dried oregano and basil, allowing the sauce to simmer for at least
      thirty minutes until thickened. This slow cooking melds the ingredients and creates a rich, hearty foundation that
      is essential to the dish.</p>
   <p>The assembly is key to achieving the perfect balance of textures. Combine ricotta cheese with an egg, Parmesan,
      and parsley to create a stable, creamy layer. In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce, then top with
      overlapping no-boil lasagna noodles. Spread a portion of the ricotta mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer
      of shredded low-moisture mozzarella, and then more meat sauce. Repeat these layers, finishing with a final blanket
      of mozzarella and Parmesan that bakes into a golden, bubbly crust.</p>
   <h3>Ingredients</h3>
   <h4>For the Meat Sauce:</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>large yellow onion, finely chopped</li>
      <li>3-4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 pound ground beef (80/20 lean-to-fat ratio is ideal)</li>
      <li>½ pound mild or sweet Italian sausage, casings removed</li>
      <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed San Marzano tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper, to taste</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>For the Cheese Filling:</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>16 ounces (about 2 cups) whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons fresh parsley, finely chopped</li>
   </ul>
   <h4>For Assembly:</h4>
   <ul>
      <li>12 no-boil (oven-ready) lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>16 ounces (about 4 cups) low-moisture, whole-milk mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>Additional ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese for the top</li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Steps</h3>
   <h4>For Sauce:</h4>
   <ol>
      <li>In a large pot or Dutch oven, sauté 1 finely chopped onion and 2-3 minced garlic cloves until softened and
         fragrant.</li>
      <li>Add 1 lb ground beef and ½ lb Italian sausage (casings removed) to the pot. Cook, breaking it up with a spoon,
         until fully browned. Drain excess fat.</li>
      <li>Stir in 1 (28 oz) can of crushed San Marzano tomatoes, 2 tablespoons of tomato paste, 1 teaspoon of dried
         oregano, and 1 teaspoon of dried basil.</li>
      <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat and let the sauce cook for at
         least 30 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
   </ol>
   <h4>For the Cheese Filling:</h4>
   <ol>
      <li>While the sauce simmers, in a separate bowl, mix 16 oz of ricotta cheese, 1 large egg, ½ cup of grated
         Parmesan cheese, and 2 tablespoons of chopped fresh parsley until well combined.</li>
   </ol>
   <h4>To Assemble:</h4>
   <ol>
      <li>Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
      <li>Spread a thin layer of the meat sauce on the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Place a layer of no-boil lasagna noodles over the sauce, slightly overlapping them.</li>
      <li>Spread one-third of the ricotta cheese mixture evenly over the noodles.</li>
      <li>Sprinkle a generous handful (about 1 cup) of shredded low-moisture mozzarella cheese over the ricotta.</li>
      <li>Spoon another layer of meat sauce over the mozzarella.</li>
      <li>Repeat the layers (noodles, ricotta, mozzarella, sauce) two more times.</li>
      <li>For the final layer, top with the remaining sauce and a final, generous sprinkling of mozzarella and Parmesan
         cheese.</li>
   </ol>
   <h4>To Bake:</h4>
   <ol>
      <li>Cover the dish tightly with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes.</li>
      <li>Remove the foil and continue baking for another 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is golden and the sauce is
         bubbling around the edges.</li>
      <li>Let the lasagna rest for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. This allows the layers to set for cleaner
         portions.</li>
   </ol>
